# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

Here are some enhancements I'd like to implement in future versions:  
- **More Animations ** – Apply subtle hover animations to buttons and cards for a smoother UX.  
- **Mobile-Friendly Enhancements ** – Improve text readability and spacing on smaller screens.
